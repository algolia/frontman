# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since Frontman is used to statically generate HTML, and therefore not used on live servers, it should not pose security vulnerabilities. 
However, in case you do find a vulnerability, please create an issue in the repository with the details of the vulnerability.
